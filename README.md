# Dates For Humans
This library is a helper to transform natural language date time info into real times. 

The original usecase for this library was a requirement to have simple configuration in a config file for date patterns (e.g. to represent "every monday"). This allowed me to make the date patterns configurable in a simple human-readable way, thereby avoiding hardcoded logic. This project has since grown into a fully-fledged natural language parser for dates/times.

## Usage
You can take any base time (e.g. `time.Now()`) and transform it using natural language. For example:

- 10 minutes ago
- 3 hours from now
- next week
- next monday
- last September
- this wednesday
- in 15 seconds
- next year
- next monday at 10pm
- today at noon
- this july
- july
- monday
- at 3pm

Example usage (see it in `example/main.go`):

### Basic Parsing

```go
now := time.Now() //e.g. 2023-07-15 17:03:00
t := datesforhumans.ParseDate(now, "next monday").At("10pm").Time() //t is a standard time.Time
fmt.Println(t.Format(time.DateTime)) //prints 2023-07-17 22:00:00

//alternatively
t2 := datesforhumans.ParseDate(now, "next monday at 10pm").Time() //t is a standard time.Time
fmt.Println(t.Format(time.DateTime)) //prints 2023-07-17 22:00:00

//or simply
t3 := datesforhumans.FromNow("next monday at 10pm").Time() //FromNow() is a shortcut for ParseDate(time.Now(), "string")
fmt.Println(t.Format(time.DateTime)) //prints 2023-07-17 22:00:00
```

### Repeating

This pattern can also be repeated until a given date:

```go
repeated := datesforhumans.ParseDate(now, "next monday").At("10pm").Repeat(datesforhumans.ParseDate(now, "next August").Time())
for _, r := range repeated {
    fmt.Println(r.Time().Format(time.DateTime))
}
// Prints:
// 2023-07-17 22:00:00
// 2023-07-24 22:00:00
// 2023-07-31 22:00:00
```

### Ranges

It's also possible to create date ranges, for example:

```go
now := time.Now() //e.g. 2023-07-15 17:03:00
r := ParseRange(now, "next monday at 10pm", "next tuesday at 11pm")
fmt.Println(r.Start.Time().Format(time.DateTime), "-", r.End.Time().Format(time.DateTime)) //prints 2023-07-17 22:00:00 - 2023-07-18 23:00:00
```

The ranges can also automatically be repeated until a given date:

```go
repeated := r.Repeat(datesforhumans.ParseDate(now, "next August").Time())
for _, r := range repeated {
    fmt.Println(r.Start.Time().Format(time.DateTime), "-", r.End.Time().Format(time.DateTime))
}
// Prints:
// 2023-07-17 22:00:00 - 2023-07-18 23:00:00
// 2023-07-24 22:00:00 - 2023-07-25 23:00:00
// 2023-07-31 22:00:00 - 2023-08-01 23:00:00
```

## Caveats
- Note that if it's July 17 and you request "next August", you'll get August 1. However if you say "in 1 month" you'll get August 17. It's worth noting there are edge cases where it's January 30 and you say "in 1 month" (returns March 2nd).
- If you give it a nonsensical input string, you'll get back the input time with the flag IsValid = false
- This library assumes a week begins with Sunday (like stdlib "time" does). So when you ask for "this sunday" on a saturday, it'll return the previous sunday instead of tomorrow
- If you say simply "july" or "monday", it assumes you mean "this july" or "this monday"
- If you provide only a time (e.g. "at 3pm"), it assumes you mean "today at 3pm"
